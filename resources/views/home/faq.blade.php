          <p class="text-gray-500">
            In general one extra bed for one child is available at a minor additional charge. However, please note that this possibility depends on each hotel’s policy and availability. We advise you to check the overview page of the hotel, or to send an email to customerservice@hms.com

          <p class="text-gray-500">
            We provide the best available rates for the dates of your stay. The discounts are already included and therefore it is not possible to have any other discount on the confirmed price.

          <p class="font-bold mb-4">Why do you need my credit card details?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500">
            In general your credit card details are only required as a guarantee for the hotel in case you don't arrive or cancel too late. This might result in a "no-show" charge (generally the equivalent to one night stay) by the hotel. We will never charge your credit card. You will pay for your stay at the hotel.

          <p class="font-bold mb-4">What are the check-in and check-out times of a hotel?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500">
            The check-in and check-out times differ. You will find them on the “Hotel Policies” section at the bottom of the overview page of the hotel. If you are going to arrive late or very early, we advise you to let the hotel know in advance using the Remarks field in the reservation form (in English or the language of the hotel if possible), or inform the hotel directly using the contact details you will find in your confirmation email.
